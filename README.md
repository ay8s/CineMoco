CineMoco
========
#####To update your controller:
1. Connect to computer via USB.
2. Navigate to and double click the "autoupdate" script in the Mac folder or 
the Windows folder for whichever OS you are running.  The Mac script should 
work on Linux as well.

#####If you are interested in hacking on the CineMoco:
The Arduino code can be found inside of "CineMoco-vX.X" folder.

Cheers!
